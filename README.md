# Face_Detector

this project is done in python language which uses the open CV library in it .OpenCV is a Python library that allows you to perform image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides a wide range of features, including object detection, face recognition.The face detector detects one or multiple human faces at a time which has extremely important applications . Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location. This algorithm is not so complex and can run in real-time. We can train a haar-cascade detector to detect various objects like human faces,cars,bikes,etc.
